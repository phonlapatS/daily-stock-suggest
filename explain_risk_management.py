print("Risk Management (RM) = Risk Control")
print("  - Stop Loss (SL): Cut loss when price drops below threshold")
print("  - Take Profit (TP): Take profit when price reaches target")
print("  - Trailing Stop: Lock profits when price rises")
print("  - Max Hold: Maximum holding days (if not hit SL/TP)")
print("  - Position Sizing: How much to invest per trade")
